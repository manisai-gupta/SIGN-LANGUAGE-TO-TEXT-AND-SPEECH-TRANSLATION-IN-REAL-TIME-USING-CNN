• The project work focuses on hand gestures using image processing.
• The main objective of the proposed system is to work as a medium of communication among deaf and dumb people
to convey the message with normal people.
• To enable the detection of gestures, we are making use of a Convolutional neural network (CNN).
• By use of the CNN algorithm, the gestures can be identified by the proposed application and converted to text,
which can then be converted into speech.

note: While technical challenges have caused the source code to elude us, we are fortunate to have the documentation that outlines its structure and functionality.
